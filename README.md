# dndler
The dndler is a tool for creating improvized game materials for Dungeons & Dragons campaigns.

# Currently Being Updated
As of September 24, 2021, the dndler is in the process of being rebuilt.  Old files can be found in the 'oldbad' folder.

### Goal
Dungeons & Dragons is a popular TTRPG that involves frequent mixing of pre-written game materials and pure improvization. The dndler hopes to simplify the improvizational aspect where applicable, such as players wanting to create random characters for one-shots or DMs trying to create multiple NPCs at once (with names and personalities included, not just a skeleton).

Other than the base Player's Handbook materials, other sources were collected from the [DnD Wiki](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/).
